The final project is a website built around a program.

The program in question is a type of game called copycat. The premise is that the computer will briefly display a random key on the keyboard which the user will "copy" or mimic by pressing the same key on their keyboard, resulting in them getting a point. If the user presses the wrong key they will instead loose a point. The game lasts for 30 seconds and when its over a game over screen will appear, allowing the user to play again if they want to.

On the website users will be able to read about the program and the process of how it came to be. There is also a contact page and of course a page where users will be able to try the program itself.

Overall, the programming part of this project was really fun. I think the most challenging part was at first the very beginning. Previously we followed the notes in the lessons to make short demos, so being completely free to make whatever you wanted was strange. To make things easier for myself I chose one of the suggested ideas in the briefing. Once I got started things went smoothly for awhile until the program started getting bigger. Being used to making short demos before and then suddenly handle a bigger program made things messy and it was easy to sort of loose yourself in the code. It was a challenge at first just keeping track of and remembering what everything did, but once I structured the code and cleaned it up things became a lot clearer.

My experience with the webdesign aspect of the project felt more challenging. Having taken both the programming and web development course, I realized that I prefer the type of work you do in the programming course over the web development course, so me not liking the webdesign part of the project as much as the programming part is no surprise. The constant tinkering with margins and trying to get everything into position was a struggle throughout the entire process. 

If I had more time to make the program I would have liked to add these things:
* Highscore
* More possible keys
* Different difficulties
* Bonus points for being on a streak

If I had more time to spend on the website I would have liekd to add these things:
* Some way to view the images better
* Fix a better logo
* Show what page the user is currently on

I did manage to stick to the budget. Since I combined the final projects in the programming course and the web development course, I ended up logging the total hours spent on the project as a whole rather than separately so I am not sure exactly how many hours went into building the website and how many went into making the actual program. I do not think I exceeded 30 hours though on either part of the project. Though it was stressful at the end, I just managed to stick to my plan and complete the project.

# User Guide
To use the program, simply go to the website and click on the "The program" link at the top menu. This will take you to a page where there are instructions on how to play the game.
