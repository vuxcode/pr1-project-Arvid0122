      <p>
        Copycat is a project created by Arvid for his final major programming project in the programming course. 
        On this page you can learn more about how the program was built and follow the process.

      <h2 class="title">The process</h2>
      <p>The project started with an idea of making a "copycat" game where the user mimics the computer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        At first the program was built using only buttons on the screen that you would click on.
        This was later expanded on when I used the same concept but replaced the buttons on the screen with keys on the keyboard.

      <p>
        for further understanding, i have included some pictures of my time report on the project, showcasing when i have worked on the
        program and what i have done.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also included some images of my bug list where i have documented all major problems i have faced and how i have solved them.
