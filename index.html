      <p>
        Copycat is a project created by a student for their programming course as their final project. 
        On this page you can learn more about how the program was built and follow the process from the start.

      <h1 class="title">The process</h1>
      <p>
        The project started with an idea of making a "copycat" game where the user mimic the computer.
        At first the program was built using only buttons on the screen that the user would click on.
        This was later expanded on by replacing the buttons with keys on the keyboard the user would press instead.
      </p>
      <p>I have included some pictures to provide a more detailed view of the process.</p>
      <p>This is a flowchart I made early in the planning stages of the project:</p>

        This is my bug list, where I have documented all major problems I have faced and how I have solved them.
