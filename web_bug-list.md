1. Problem: Want to add a colored background area where text will be. Solved: used a div, adjusted the size and changed the background color. Also learned how to push it behind all other elements using "position" and z-index.
   
2. Problem: When the text telling the user what key to press disappears, all text under moves up and then down when the text reappears again, making everything jump up and down when playing the game. Solution: Made a div with the text in it and set it in a fixed position.
   
3. Problem: Want to put the timer and score counter beside eachother, currently on top of eachother. Solution: Put both paragraphs in a div and use css to adjust them.
